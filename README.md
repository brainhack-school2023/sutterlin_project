## Project description 

This project aims to better understand neural correlates of hypnosis, which is defined as an experiential experience of focused attention and heighten reponse to suggestions. Hypnotic experience can be assessed in part with the automaticity associated with hypnotic experience, with hypnotic depth and with hypnotizalibility scores. The brain's functionnal connectivity might reflect which brain regions interact to produce the subjective change in phenomenological experience associated with hypnosis. 

### Main questions
- Does the resting brain activity prior to hypnosis predict variables reflecting hypnosis such as sense of automaticity, hyptonitazability and hypnotic depth?
- Does the functionnal connectivity activity contrasted from post-hypnosis vs pre-hypnosis can predict hypnosis-related variables?
- What are the main brain regions for which functionnal connectivity is largely increased or decreased by hypnosis?
